    <div class="nuruldep"><p>Welcome to Jahangirnagar University! It is our pleasure to present to you this website, because it will now allow you to visit Jahangirnagar virtually no matter where you are.<br>

        Jahangirnagar University (JU) started with a modest beginning. Having only 150 students in four departments – Departments of Economics, Geography, Mathematics and Statistics – and a small official building in the year 1970, the university has come a long way and, in 2012, is one of the leading universities of the country. Presently, JU accommodates 6 Faculties, 36 Departments, 5 Institutes and Centers, 800 teachers, and more than 14000 students. Number is, however, just one important feature to understand JU. This eco-friendly and spectacular university is spread out over nearly 300 hectares of land, a major portion of which form lush forests and beautiful lakes. You may know that JU is the first residential university in Bangladesh. Interestingly, it is also a haven for exquisite range of flora and fauna, wildlife and butterflies, and, of course, migratory birds. I take pride in mentioning that JU retains one of the top 10 places in the world where the highest number of birds visit at a time. Equally wonderful are the buildings, monuments, and other installations of the university, most of which, being unique, maintain certain form and texture. Jahangirnagar University is at one with nature which is precisely why our students and teachers have developed and maintained a sense of originality and creativity, qualities that any centre of higher learning must cherish and encourage. All these have resulted in exciting academic, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities – ranging from international conferences and regular publication of scholarly journals to increasing success in art, literature and national sports to arrangement of pulsating cultural rituals and activities throughout the year – that have left JU vibrant and updated. It is in recognition of this that the renowned playwright Selim Al Deen, a former faculty of JU, declared his beloved university as the cultural capital of Bangladesh.<br>
        
        As the Vice-Chancellor of JU, I will ensure that the strides taken by Jahangirnagar University in the days ahead are made towards academic excellence and intellectual freedom. Our aim is to build Jahangirnagar University as a national leader in creating centers of learning, teaching, and research. To ensure this, it is imperative to uphold the Jahangirnagar University Act 1973 that safeguards our autonomy. I seek your cooperation to discharge the noble responsibility that has been entrusted upon me. Jahangirnagar University has come a long way and it has a long way to go. I strongly believe that it is our concerted efforts that can make our journey towards knowledge, enlightenment, and liberation successful.</p>
